# kyoot

Algebraic effects for TypeScript. A program is a value whose type lists the effects it uses. You handle them one at a time with `pipe`, and run the program once the list is empty.

```ts
import { Env, Fail, Kyoot, Sync } from "kyoot";

const Db = Env.tag<{ find(id: string): string | undefined }>()("db");

class NotFound {
  readonly _tag = "NotFound";
}

const lookup = (id: string) =>
  Kyoot.gen(function* () {
    const db = yield* Db;
    const name = yield* Sync.defer(() => db.find(id));
    if (name === undefined) return yield* Fail.fail(new NotFound());
    return name;
  });
// Kyoot<string, { "env/db": { find: ... }; fail: NotFound; sync: () => unknown }>

const result = lookup("42").pipe(
  Db.provide({ find: (id) => (id === "42" ? "douglas" : undefined) }),
  Fail.run,
  Sync.run,
  Kyoot.runSync,
);
// Result<NotFound, string>, here { ok: true, value: "douglas" }
```

The second type parameter is the row: one key per effect still to handle. `runSync` and `runPromise` reject a program with keys left, and the error names them:

```ts
Kyoot.runSync(lookup("42"));
// Type error: Unhandled<"env/db" | "fail" | "sync">
```

## Effects and handlers

An effect is a key, a payload type, and an answer type. Calling it performs an op.

```ts
const Log = effect<string, void>()("log");
Log("hello");
// Kyoot<void, { log: string }>
```

A handler catches one key and resumes the program. `resume` is typed to the answer; `resume(value)` continues with a value, `resume.with(program)` with a computation run where the op was.

```ts
const printLogs = Log.handle({
  onOp: (line, resume) => Sync.defer(() => console.log(line)).map(resume),
});
// <A, S>(k: Kyoot<A, S>) => Kyoot<A, Omit<S, "log"> & { sync: () => unknown }>
```

`intercept` sits between the program and the handlers outside it. It gets the payload and a `next` that performs the op again for them to answer; whatever it returns is delivered where the op was performed. A cache, a sandbox, or a system prompt is an intercept.

```ts
const Fetch = effect<string, string>()("fetch");
const program = Fetch("hot");
const cache = Fetch.intercept((url, next) => (url === "hot" ? Kyoot.succeed("cached") : next(url)));
const live = Fetch.handle({ onOp: (url, resume) => resume(`fetched ${url}`) });
program.pipe(cache, live);
```

An interceptor is a program, so it can log, sleep, read a `Var`, or perform another effect; its row joins the program's. Pass `{ create }` first and `f` gets a cell as its third argument, made fresh per run and shared with fibers forked under it:

```ts
const memo = Fetch.intercept({ create: () => new Map<string, string>() }, (url, next, seen) =>
  seen.has(url) ? Kyoot.succeed(seen.get(url)!) : next(url).map((a) => (seen.set(url, a), a)),
);
```

Every built-in intercepts. `Log`, `Random`, `Clock`, `Sync`, and `Async` are declared with `effect`, so `Clock.intercept((ms, next) => next(ms / 10))` scales every sleep. `Emit`, `Fail`, and `Resource` take the type first, since their payload varies per program: `Emit.intercept<Order>()((e, next) => …)`. `Env` and `Var` tags carry `intercept`, so `Db.intercept((_, next) => next().map(wrap))` decorates a service and `Balance.intercept` can refuse a `set`. Two things to know: `Fail.intercept` can pass a failure on (`next(e)`) or raise another, but not recover — that is `catchAll`; and a fiber forked through `Async.intercept` inherits the handlers inside it, so a `Log.collect` between the program and the interceptor still sees the fiber's logs.

`makeHandler` is the full form. It can carry state — `initial`, threaded through `resume`, or `create()`, a cell made fresh per run — and reshape the final value with `onSuccess`. `Clock.virtual` is a handler with state:

```ts
const virtual = <A, S extends Row & { clock?: number }>(k: Kyoot<A, S>) =>
  makeHandler("clock", k, {
    initial: 0,
    onOp: (ms, resume, now) => resume(undefined, now + ms),
    onSuccess: (a, now) => Kyoot.succeed([a, now] as const),
  });
// Kyoot<readonly [A, number], Omit<S, "clock">>
```

The row is a plain object type: each key maps to its payload type. `yield*` unions rows, a handler removes its key, and `RowsOf<typeof program>` reads it back.

Tags are keyed by id: `Env.tag<A>()("a")` and `Env.tag<B>()("b")` are separate keys. `Env` hands out a constant; `Var` threads state.

`Resource.run` releases in reverse order on success, defect, interrupt, or when an outside handler finishes without resuming. `close` may return a program, so a finalizer can do async work. A finalizer that throws never hides a defect or an interrupt. After a success it is raised — and a typed failure that `Fail.run` inside has already turned into a `Result` counts as a success.

`Clock.sleep` runs on real timers under `runPromise` unless a handler is closer. `Clock.virtual` makes every sleep instant and reports the elapsed time, so a program that waits can run under `runSync` in tests.

`Retry.run` re-runs a program on a typed failure, sleeping between attempts (`delay` is a number or `(attempt) => ms`). Set `while` to retry only some failures. Defects are not retried; the last failure stays in the row.

## Streams

A stream is a program that emits. `Emit.fromAsyncIterable` turns an async source into one; `Emit.map` and `Emit.forEach` transform and consume it, and a `forEach` callback may return a program, whose effects join the row. `Emit.toAsyncIterable(k, { buffer })` runs it in a fiber and hands values out as they arrive; the producer runs at most `buffer` values ahead (16 by default, 1 is pull), and breaking out of the loop interrupts it.

## Async

`runPromise` serves `async` and `clock` itself and knows nothing about any other effect.

```ts
const main = Kyoot.gen(function* () {
  const fast = yield* Async.race(fetchUser("a"), fetchUser("b"));
  const fiber = yield* Async.fork(slowJob);
  const result = yield* Async.timeout(5000, fiber.join).pipe(Fail.run);
  return [fast, result];
});

await Kyoot.runPromise(main);
```

`fork` returns a fiber with `join`, `await` (a `Result`), and `interrupt`. A fiber inherits the handlers around the fork, so the forked program's row lands on the parent's: fork something that needs `env/db`, and the `provide` outside the fork answers inside it. The fiber keeps only `async` and `clock`, which its driver serves; a typed failure crosses `join` (`Fiber<A, E>`). `race`, `all`, and `timeout` merge their branches' rows the same way. `all` runs all branches at once by default; set `concurrency` to limit them. If time runs out, `timeout` fails with `Timeout`.

```ts
const main = Kyoot.gen(function* () {
  const fiber = yield* Async.fork(lookup("42")); // needs env/db, may fail with NotFound
  return yield* fiber.join; // fail: NotFound, here
}).pipe(Db.provide(db), Fail.run, Sync.run);
```

A handler says what it does at a fork with `fork`:

- `"copy"` (default): the fiber gets `onOp` with the frame's state. A `create` cell is shared, so `Log.collect` and `Emit.collect` see the fiber's output; threaded state is a snapshot, so a `Var` set in a fiber is not seen after `join`.
- `"scope"`: the fiber gets a frame of its own, with `onSuccess` at its end. `Resource.run` does this, so each fiber has its own scope.
- `"none"`: the handler stops at the fiber.

`fail` handlers never cross into a fiber: the failure crosses `join` and meets the handlers there.

Interrupting a fiber interrupts its children and runs their finalizers; once an interrupt is delivered, the ops that follow are cleanup and run to completion. `fromPromise` passes an `AbortSignal`; give it to `fetch` and an interrupt cancels the request. A fiber yields to the event loop every few thousand steps, so a hot loop neither starves other fibers nor blocks its own interrupt (a loop inside one `Sync.defer` is one step). `runSync` never yields.

## Your own effect

Declare one `effect` and one handler per interpretation. `examples/checkout.ts` does this for a business program: `Inventory` and `Payments` are effects; the handlers are an in-memory stock table and a test double.

A handler may fail instead of resuming. The failure then belongs to the handler's scope and shows up in the row at that step; the program inside cannot catch it.

```ts
const Payments = effect<Charge, string>()("payments");
const declineAll = (reason: string) =>
  Payments.handle({ onOp: () => Fail.fail(new PaymentDeclined(reason)) });
```

When the failure is part of the effect's contract, declare it as the third type argument and hand it back with `resume.with`. It is raised where the op was performed, so the program's own `catchTag` sees it.

```ts
const Payments = effect<Charge, string, PaymentDeclined>()("payments");
const declineAll = (reason: string) =>
  Payments.handle({ onOp: (_, resume) => resume.with(Fail.fail(new PaymentDeclined(reason))) });
```

`op<A>()(key, payload)` is the one-off form underneath `effect`, for ops whose payload type varies per call.

`examples/service.ts` shows the shape for a service library: the model call and search are effects; providers and test doubles are handlers that may retry, stream tokens with `Emit`, log, and fail with a typed error, each showing in the row at the step that adds it. See `@kyoot/ai` for the real AI library.

## Rules

- `resume` works once; a second call throws.
- A thrown exception is a defect: it skips `onOp` and goes to the nearest `onDefect`, or out of `runSync`. Use `Fail` for errors you expect.
- A handler that does not resume drops the rest of the program. Handler order does not affect resource cleanup, but it still affects meaning because the nearest matching handler handles an operation first.
- A handler that returns a value instead of resuming must be `fork: "none"`, since a fiber's value is its own. A copy that does so anyway is reported as a defect.
- A handler's `onInterrupt` hook may return a program. Its effects join the handler's row.
